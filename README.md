# rechercher.py #

A theoretical exercise to implement many Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence algorithms as search, just as they are said to be.

Planned algorithms include:
* Uninformed Search
* Informed Search
* Local Search
* Partial-Order Planning
* GraphPlan
* Constraint-Satisfaction
* Resolution

The name of this project, `rechercher`, is a bilingual pun: rechercher in French means "to search for", and it also sounds/looks like "researcher" in English.
